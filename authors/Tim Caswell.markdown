I have worked for almost a decade on web based applications using a variety of open-source technologies. I'm most interested currently in moving web apps towards an architecture where the front-end is a smart javascript application and the back-end is simply a resource provider.

Currently I work for Sencha Inc. as a senior software developer.  I'm in charge of building the node.js community and helping it become a solid platform for businesses to build on.
